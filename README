Building from Source:

	Notes:
		
		The code only works for debian sid/squeeze and ubuntu maverick currently due to an
		issue with osgstateset with osg  version < 2.8.3

	Get the dependencies:

		For debian sid/squeeze and ubuntu maverick:
		sudo apt-get install cmake libqt4-dev simgear-dev liblapack-dev libboost-all-dev libopenscenegraph-dev gfortran

	Build the code:
	
		./autobuild.sh

Packaging:

	CPack may by used for packaging.
	
	For example:
	cd build; cpack -g TGZ, will generate a tarball of the source.
	cd build; cpack -g DEB, will generate a debian package.
	cd build; cpack -g ZIP, will generate a zip of the source.
